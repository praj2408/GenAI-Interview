### **ONNX, TensorRT, and Triton Inference Server Overview**  

1. **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)**  
   - ONNX is an open-source format to represent deep learning models.  
   - It enables interoperability between different deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet).  
   - It allows models trained in one framework to be exported and used in another.  

2. **TensorRT (NVIDIA TensorRT)**  
   - TensorRT is an SDK from NVIDIA designed for optimizing and accelerating deep learning models for inference.  
   - It applies optimizations like precision calibration (FP32 → FP16 or INT8), kernel fusion, and layer optimizations to speed up model inference.  
   - It is commonly used for real-time AI applications, including image recognition, NLP, and video analytics.  
   - **Where do we use TensorRT?**  
     - Optimizing and accelerating deep learning models for inference on NVIDIA GPUs.  
     - Deployed in AI applications like autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and real-time video processing.  
     - Integrated with frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX.  

3. **Triton Inference Server (NVIDIA Triton)**  
   - Triton is an open-source inference server that allows deploying and managing AI models in production.  
   - It supports multiple backends, including TensorRT, TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and custom Python models.  
   - Provides features like model ensemble, dynamic batching, and multi-GPU/multi-node support.  
   - **Where do we use Triton?**  
     - Deploying and managing AI inference at scale in cloud, edge, and on-premise environments.  
     - Used in industries like healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving to serve AI models efficiently.  
     - Ideal for AI model serving in Kubernetes, cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP), and enterprise AI deployments.  

### **How They Work Together**
1. Train a deep learning model in **TensorFlow/PyTorch** → Convert it to **ONNX** format.  
2. Optimize the ONNX model using **TensorRT** for fast inference.  
3. Deploy the optimized model on **Triton Inference Server** for efficient large-scale AI inference.
